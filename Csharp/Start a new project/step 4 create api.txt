STEPS 1 - 3 must be done!

1- Clone the bitbucket api repo to the local
2- add the git gitignore to the cloned folder
3- Open up a new project and create a new asp.net core api project
4- name it org.nedarc.clms.api
5- pick traget framework 5.0 no auth, deselect https and create
6- add a new testing project
7- commit and close 
8- create a fork of the project in bitbucket
9- delete the main project and pull the frok 
10- open the project and add the Default.html page 
11- pull the authentication library into the project


This would be part I of the API lib.  Next part is we have to add the administration Lib to pull back a user from the database
