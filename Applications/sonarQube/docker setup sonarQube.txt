Setup:

Install Docker
GoTo SonarQube and grab the docker pull for Community Ed this will need to be ran in powershell : docker pull sonarqube:8.6-community
Launch Docker and go to images (this is the gui) and install and run the SonarQube image ***we will need to get better with the command line here
Run SonarQube on port 9000 and launch in a new window : user name is admin password is admin
Click on the Admin account and pick my account
Click on security and create a new token I called mine cubeToken


install Sonar Qube for C# and create a new project
Make sure your sonarCube is running and your logged into the system on port 9000
Click on projects and create a new project: I just gave mine a name of my-key and copied the token that was created when we set everything up from the home
Since our projects are now all Core we will just install sonarCube to our global path to do this open powershell and run these: dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner
Once this is done cd into the project path we will be testing in powershell and run the following in powershell dotnet sonarscanner begin /k:"project-key" /d:sonar.login="myAuthenticationToken" *then dotnet build <path to solution.sln> *then dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login="myAuthenticationToken"
*Found it easier to run the tests instead of the build seems to be passing when build doesn't dotnet test <path to solution.sln>
