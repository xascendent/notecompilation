steps:
1- create a new repo in bitbuck and make it blank.
2- clone the empty project down to your local rig
3- All projects will now be: org.nedarc.<feature>
4- copy the .gitignore to the new project in the same location as .git
5- create a new empty project in .net 5 .  In our case it will be a class library and the project name for this example will be: org.nedarc.authentication
6- point the location to the cloned empty repo space on the rig
7- delete the Class1 file and add a new project called NUnit 
8- in the org.nedarc.authentication.tests click on the dependancies add project and pick org.nedarc.authentication
9- save the project and close
10- since we have tortoise git installed right click on the root folder of the project and upload all the files.. 
    a- push the .gitignore file only first
    b- push the others
11- now we have to create a fork in our main repo goto: https://stash.utahdcc.org/stash/projects/NEDARCSW/repos/nedarc-clms_authentication/browse
12- create a fork put it in the same project repo and call it: Nedarc-Clms_Authentication-Fork
13- now delete the main project repo and download the fork
14- MOVE ON to step 2 create a new Service
